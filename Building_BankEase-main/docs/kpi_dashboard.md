Objective : The KPI Manager Dashboard is designed to provide bank managers with a clear, centralized view of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer behavior.  The tool enables graphical visualization of trends and patterns, supporting data-driven strategic decision-making. The interface includes dynamic filtering by month and year, ensuring all charts and metrics adapt to the selected period.

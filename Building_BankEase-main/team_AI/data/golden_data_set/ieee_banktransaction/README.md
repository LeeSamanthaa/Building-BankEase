# ðŸ“¾ Golden Dataset - Matching and Merging IEEE Fraud Dataset with Bank Transactions

## Overview

This dataset merges two key sources:

* **Fraud Engine**: IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection Dataset
* **Recommendation/Insights Engine**: Bank Transactions Dataset

Records from both datasets were matched **one-to-one** based on user behavior patterns and linked via a shared synthetic `guid`. This enables unified user-level context for fraud, recommendation, and insight engines.

---

## Objectives

* Align user records across different engines (Fraud, Recommendation, Insights)
* Provide a consistent schema with shared identifiers
* Prepare clean, realistic data for demos, dashboards, and modeling

---

## Matching Logic

* **Features Used**: `Amount`, `Card1`, `Transaction Time`
* **Normalization**: StandardScaler applied to align feature scale
* **Matching Method**: Greedy nearest-neighbor based on Euclidean distance
* **Constraint**: One-to-one matching (no duplicates)
* **GUID**: Generated using `uuid.uuid4()` per matched pair

---

## File Details

* `cleaned_merged_guid_df.csv`
  Merged dataset with suffixes applied: `_ieee` for fraud source, `_bank` for recommendation source

* **Example Columns**:

  * `TransactionID_ieee`, `TransactionTS_ieee`
  * `TransactionID_bank`, `TransactionTS_bank`
  * `guid` (common identifier)

* **Non-null Filter**:

  * Columns with **<90% completeness** were removed to ensure data quality
